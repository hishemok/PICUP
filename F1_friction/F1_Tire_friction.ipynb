    "In this project, we will dive into the into the high-speed world of Formula 1 racing. Not as a spectator, but as a data scientist and a physicist. Using real telemetry data from the 2025 British Grand Prix, we will analyze how some of the world's best drivers navigate Corner 15 at Silverstone, one of the fastest and most demanding corners in the sport.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will calculate how fast these cars go, how tightly they turn, and how much grip their tires need to generate to avoid slipping off the track. Along the way, you'll build a physics-based model of tire grip from the ground up, starting with Newtonian mechanics and working step-by-step toward a more complete understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is not just about crunching numbers; it's about understanding the fundamental physics that allows these cars to corner at such high speeds. You will start with a simple model based on Newton's laws of motion, calculating the necessary friction coefficient for cornering. To understand how these cars defy the limits of ordinary driving, you will learn how aerodynamics fundamentally changes the game. And by building a simple model of how downforce affects tire grip, you will create a more accurate and physics-informed picture of what allows an F1 car to corner at such high speeds.\n",
